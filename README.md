## 🧩 Project Overview: Scalable & Extensible Tic Tac Toe Game (Java - OOPs, LLD, SOLID)

This is a command-line based **Tic Tac Toe** game designed from the ground up using **Object-Oriented Principles**, **Low-Level Design (LLD)** skills, and **Design Patterns**. The core goal of this project is not just to build a playable game, but to demonstrate how even a simple game like Tic Tac Toe can be structured and scaled with professional-grade software engineering practices.

The application follows:
- **OOP Principles**: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- **SOLID Principles**: Ensuring code is maintainable, extensible, and testable
- **Design Patterns**: Implemented patterns include:
  - 🧱 **Builder Pattern** – For flexible board creation
  - 🏭 **Factory Pattern** – For player and symbol instantiation
  - 🧵 **Singleton Pattern** – For managing shared resources like the game instance
  - 🚪 **Open/Closed Principle**, **Liskov Substitution**, and others to maintain robust architecture

## 🎮 Features

- ✅ 2-player mode and bot vs player
- 🤖 Bot strategy using rule-based logic (Minimax AI coming soon)
- 🏆 Flexible winning strategies (row, column, diagonal based)
- 🧩 Fully extensible game board (3x3 or NxN)
- ♻️ Easy to plug in additional rules or game modes
- 👨‍💻 Clean separation of concerns (Model, Controller, Strategy layers)
